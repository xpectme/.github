## Greetings stranger!

### Who am I?

I'm Mario St√∂cklein, the founder of XP.LIVE. I'm dedicated to revolutionizing the ticket sales and verification system.

### What is this organization all about?

xpectme is my public Github organization where I showcase my work and contribute to the tech community. Through xpectme, I hope to share my passion for technology by publishing high-quality, open-source components that are used within my company. Although still in the early stages, I am eager to grow and evolve this organization, and any support, whether through contributions or sponsorship, is greatly appreciated.
